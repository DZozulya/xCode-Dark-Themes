Popular dark xCode themes with slight modifications

###TomorrowDark
Theme I use for everyday coding. It is really good for eyes, and it got colors for every type of syntax you use.

###Resesif
Another good dark theme, for me colors are good for eyes too but contrast between them too low. So I use this theme from time to time.

###Monokai Revisited
One of the best dark xCode themes, it has only one minus - colors are too bright and contrast, so my eyes quickly getting tired. So I use this theme in rare cases mostly when I need to inspect third party code.
