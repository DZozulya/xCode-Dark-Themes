Popular dark xCode themes with slight modifications

###Solarized - Light V2
My vision of Solarized Light theme for xCode 6. Swapped some colors for better code readability. Original Solarized theme based on xCode default highlighting which doesn't determine colors for Class Name, Constant, Type Name etc. This version uses same colors as original theme (only custom color is for cursor).

###TomorrowDark
Theme I use for everyday coding. It is really good for eyes, and it got colors for every type of syntax you use.

###Resesif
Another good dark theme, for me colors are good for eyes too but contrast between them too low. So I use this theme from time to time.

###Monokai Revisited
One of the best dark xCode themes, it has only one minus - colors are too bright and contrast, so my eyes quickly getting tired. So I use this theme in rare cases mostly when I need to inspect third party code.
